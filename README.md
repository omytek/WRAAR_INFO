Initial Design of Wing Runs In Arch Arrangement Ramp

Ramps are used by vehicles to move up or down between positions with a different in height.
For example a forklift moving down from a platform to the floor or a motorbike moving up to a truck from the floor.

In order to withstand heavy loading of moving vehicles, fixed position ramps are normally required to be bulky steel or reinforced concrete structure.

Portable ramps however are faced with the challenges of not only withstanding heavy loads but also lightweight enough for user handling.
Majority of manufaturers have adopted to using aluminum alloy as the primary solution to this problem.
Aluminum alloys are far more lighter that steel that can withstand the load.

However aluminum alloy constrcution are very costly :

Raw material cost are much higher.
Aluminum alloy can be easily damage during welding and cutting.
Alumimium alloy are also less elastic than steel.
Alumimium profile extrusion design are also more complicated than steel.
Due to manufaturers primary or singular strategy aluminium alloys, more focus is placed on engineering design suited for aluminium.
Rather than more engineering more efficient generic ramp design.

Therefore , Wing Runs In Arch Arrangement Ramp was developed to be a more cost saving and efficient design suitable for different materials.
